# Art API SQL
Richard Johnston <techpowerawaits@outlook.com>

This folder contains any SQL functions that are used within the supabase instance in order to allow reproducibility and verification.

|===
| SQL | Route(s) Used In | Code File | Info

| link:ArtistName.sql[]
| /api/counts/artists
| link:../counts.mjs[counts.mjs]
| Makes it easier to return a combined first-last name.

| link:GenrePaintingCount.sql[]
|
/api/counts/genres/_ref_
/api/counts/topgenres/_ref_
| link:../counts.mjs[counts.mjs]
| PostgREST--at the time this API was made--did not support the `having` SQL clause, which made it difficult to filter by painting count (and thus, handle the latter route).
Since both routes return similar data, it was decided to use a similar SQL function for both of them.
